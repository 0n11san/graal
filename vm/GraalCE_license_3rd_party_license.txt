The GNU General Public License (GPL)

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 
330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share 
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to 
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most 
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose 
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to 
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for 
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make 
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) 
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute 
and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that 
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the 
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to 
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish 
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually 
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent 
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's 
free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice 
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program 
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not 
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of 
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the 
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of 
this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be 
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print 
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print 
an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License.

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 
2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable 
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the 
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed 
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though 
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Program or works based on it.

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the 
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, 
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may 
not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties to this License.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement 
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed 
on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the 
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all 
those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way 
you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such 
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of 
this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies 
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", 
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that 
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If 
the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose 
distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally.
NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU 
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible 
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software 
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach 
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found.

One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it 
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
type 'show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate 
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be 
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be 
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, 
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is 
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider 
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If 
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead 
of this License.

"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL

Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates 
are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2, 
based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the 
GNU Classpath Exception, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the 
particular source file's header the words "Oracle designates this particular 
file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the 
LICENSE file that accompanied this code."

You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in 
this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses 
deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others. 
For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License, 
Version 2.0. Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.

Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the 
Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you 
to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed 
under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to commingle code 
under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for 
example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle's 
GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.

Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the 
files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be 
required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under 
the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms 
of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath 
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further 
distribute the package.

Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer 
skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or 
making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed 
and/or involve the use of third party software.

CLASSPATH EXCEPTION

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a 
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU 
General Public License version 2 cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you 
permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an 
executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and 
to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, 
provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and 
conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module 
which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, 
you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not 
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception 
statement from your version.

     #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
     #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
     #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
     #
     #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
     #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
     #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
     #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
     #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
     #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
     #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
     #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
     #
     #  NO WARRANTY
     #
     #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
     #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
     #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
     #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
     #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
     #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
     #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
     #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
     #  any right of any third party.
     #
     #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
     #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
     #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
     #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
     #
     #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
     #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
     #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
     #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
     #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
     #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
     #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
     #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
     #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
     #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
     #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
     #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
     #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
     #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
     #  production of secondary products from the program.
     #
     #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
     #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
     #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
     #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
     #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
     #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
     #  above as far as the program is concerned.

    5. Time Zone Database

      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
    Database section 7.

     # 7.  Database Ownership
     #
     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

    The Artistic License 2.0

    Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    Preamble

    This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
    Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
    The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
    control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
    Package available as open source and free software.

    You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
    license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
    terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
    make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
    a different licensing arrangement.

    Definitions

        "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)
        named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

        "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
        material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
        procedures.

        "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy,
        distribute, or modify the Package.

        "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of
        those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard
        Version, or a Modified Version.

        "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
        accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
        organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

        "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
        this Package or providing support for this Package to another
        party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

        "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
        modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
        by the Copyright Holder.

        "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
        such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
        Holder.

        "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with
        the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as
        it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

        "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
        configuration files for the Package.

        "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,
        or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or
        translation of the Source form.

    Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

    (1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
    Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
    you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

    Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

    (2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
    Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
    either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
    all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
    your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
    Compiled form of the Package.

    (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
    modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
    will be subject to the Original License.

    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
    you do at least ONE of the following:

        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
        of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
        Version.

        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
        prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
        from the name of the Standard Version.

        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
        under

            (i)  the Original License or

            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
            Fees are allowed.

    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
    or Modified Versions without the Source

    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
    the Source of the Modified Version.

    Aggregating or Linking the Package

    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
    as included in the aggregation.

    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
    terms of this license.

    General Provisions

    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
    license.

    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
    this license.

    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,
    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any
    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
    date that such litigation is filed.

    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:
    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS
    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
    NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL
    LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
available in Executable form must also be made available in
Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
from the rights set forth in this License. If You
distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
the license and remove any references to the name of the
license steward (except to note that the license differs
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
or the Original Software where the Participant is the
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
Participant Software against such Participant either
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
Participant.

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly
or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
§ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.

any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
United States export administration regulations (and the export
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
of liability.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
available in Executable form must also be made available in
Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
different from this License, provided that You are in
compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
from the rights set forth in this License. If You
distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.

Oracle is the initial license steward and
may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received
the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
the license and remove any references to the name of the
license steward (except to note that the license differs
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
or the Original Software where the Participant is the
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
Participant Software against such Participant either
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
Participant.

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly
or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the

applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of

======
========================= EPL-v10 =========================

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC 
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM 
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a 
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone 
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in 
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are 
not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when 
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and 
such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise 
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and 
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the 
Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the 
Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be 
covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any 
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to 
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any 
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual 
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability 
to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of 
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the 
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole 
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. 
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to 
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that 
license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license 
set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under 
its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title 
and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability 
and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential 
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by 
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, 
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a 
medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the 
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if 
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the 
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with 
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is 
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if 
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages 
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal 
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the 
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in 
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product 
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order 
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial 
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor 
to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and 
any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may 
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product 
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that 
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties 
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such 
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court 
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial 
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN 
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each 
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using 
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise 
of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and 
costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of 
data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST 
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, 
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY 
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS 
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable 
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the 
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such 
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such 
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself 
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) 
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted 
under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to 
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does 
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of 
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as 
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement

and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in 
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be 
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to

this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this 
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year

Use of EclipseLink version 2.5.2 is governed by the terms of the license below:

License

The Eclipse Foundation makes available all content in this plug-in ("Content").
Unless otherwise indicated below, the Content is provided to you under the terms
and conditions of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 ("EPL") and Eclipse
Distribution License Version 1.0 (“EDL”). For purposes of the EPL, "Program"
will mean the Content.

If you did not receive this Content directly from the Eclipse Foundation, the
Content is being redistributed by another party ("Redistributor") and different
terms and conditions may apply to your use of any object code in the Content.
Check the Redistributor’s license that was provided with the Content. If no 
such
license exists, contact the Redistributor. Unless otherwise indicated below, the
terms and conditions of the EPL and EDL still apply to any source code in the
Content and such source code may be obtained at http://www.eclipse.org.

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

     1.8. ``License'' means this document.

     1.9. ``Modifications'' means any addition to or deletion from the
     substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous
     Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a
     Modification is:

          A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
          containing Original Code or previous Modifications.

          B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or
          previous Modifications.

     1.10. ``Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software code
     which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as
     Original Code, and which, at the time of its release under this License
     is not already Covered Code governed by this License.

     1.11. ``Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
     making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
     compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of source code
     differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
     well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
     Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
     appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
     for no charge.

     1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
     under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future
     version of this License issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities,
     ``You'' includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is
     under common control with You. For purposes of this definition,
     ``control'' means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
     direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
     otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
     outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. Source Code License.

     2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
     The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
     claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
          distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without
          Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
          Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the
          Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that
          any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize
          the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater
          extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
          combinations.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
     claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
          distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
          portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
          Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
          Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
          thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is
          reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
          Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that
          may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
     only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
     License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
     License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
     offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
     restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
     rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
     offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
     Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
     provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
     Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
          right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization
          under this License), you must include a text file with the source
          code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
          the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
          will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You
          make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
          shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
          available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
          appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
          inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
          been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Your Modification is an application programming interface and
          You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
          implement that API, you must also include this information in the
          LEGAL file.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where
     You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You
     created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
     Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible
     to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
     structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a
     relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such
     a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
     of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
     not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must
     make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
     indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
     incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
     Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
     description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
     Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in
     an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
     describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
     distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
     Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
     that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
     or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
     rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
     version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
     that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
     not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
     indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
     incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
     any such terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute
     or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
     to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
     the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
     file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
     distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
     statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
     for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
     be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the
     phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or
     any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
     Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
     not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
     PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
     OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
     GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
     ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
     BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT
     EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer
     software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
     provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
     respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
     entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of
     America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating
     to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual
     property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,
     with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any
     arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara
     County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any
     litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the
     jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
     California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with
     the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
     court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application
     of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
     Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
     provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
     drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
     Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
     indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
     on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the
     revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant
     factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute
     responsibility on an equitable basis.

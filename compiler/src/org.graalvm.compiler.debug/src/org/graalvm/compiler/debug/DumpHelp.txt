Filter pattern for specifying scopes in which dumping is enabled.

A filter is a list of comma-separated terms of the form:
 
  <pattern>[:<level>]
 
If <pattern> contains a "*" or "?" character, it is interpreted as a glob pattern.
Otherwise, it is interpreted as a substring. If <pattern> is empty, it
matches every scope. If :<level> is omitted, it defaults to 1. The term
~<pattern> is a shorthand for <pattern>:0 to disable a debug facility for a pattern.

The resulting level of a scope is determined by the last matching term.
If no term matches, the level is 0 (disabled). A filter with no terms matches every
scope with a level of 1.

Examples of debug filters:
--------- 
  (empty string)

  Matches any scope with level 1.
--------- 
  :1

  Matches any scope with level 1.
--------- 
  *

  Matches any scope with level 1.
--------- 
  CodeGen,CodeInstall

  Matches scopes containing "CodeGen" or "CodeInstall", both with level 1.
--------- 
  CodeGen:2,CodeInstall:1

  Matches scopes containing "CodeGen" with level 2, or "CodeInstall" with level 1.
--------- 
  :1,Dead:2

  Matches scopes containing "Dead" with level 2, and all other scopes with level 1.
--------- 
  :1,Dead:0

  Matches all scopes with level 1, except those containing "Dead".
--------- 
  Code*

  Matches scopes starting with "Code" with level 1.
--------- 
  Code,~Dead

  Matches scopes containing "Code" but not "Dead", with level 1.
